# cdbdirect

`cdbdirect` is a proof of concept implementation to directly probe a local copy of a snapshot of the Chess Cloud Database (cdb),
which is also [accessible online](https://www.chessdb.cn/queryc_en/).

Even though API access to cdb is easily possible (see e.g. [cdbexplore](https://github.com/vondele/cdbexplore/) or [cdblib](https://github.com/robertnurnberg/cdblib/) for tools that do so), local access can be significantly faster.

## Usage

### Binaries

The single threaded PoC code just probes the local copy of cdb and prints the ranked moves with
their scores for all fens in a specific file. Note that fens should have
`-` for the ep if no legal ep move is possible (including pinned pawns), and that
move counters are ignored. By default the file is assumed to be
`caissa_sorted_100000.epd` available at
[caissatrack](https://github.com/robertnurnberg/caissatrack)) :

```
./cdbdirect
```

sample output:

```

```

The threaded version of the PoC code looks for fens that are unknown to cdb in
a specific file, and writes them to `unknown.epd` :

```
./cdbdirect_threaded grob_popular_T60t7_cdb.epd
```

sample output:

```
Loading: grob_popular_T60t7_cdb.epd
Opened DB with 44262943988 stored positions.

scored moves: 183986252
Required probing time:         74.5051 sec.
Required time per fen: 2.08377 microsec.
```

### Interface

The interface to probe has been kept very simple, with only 4 functions exposed by `cdbdirect.h`

```
std::uintptr_t cdbdirect_initialize(const std::string &path);
std::uint64_t cdbdirect_size(std::uintptr_t handle);
std::uintptr_t cdbdirect_finalize(std::uintptr_t handle);
std::vector<std::pair<std::string, int>> cdbdirect_get(std::uintptr_t handle,
                                                       const std::string &fen);
```

See the `Makefile` for how a tool can link to the `libcdbdirect.a` library.

## Building

Once prerequisites are available building is as simple as

```
make -j
```

## Prerequisites

### A cdb database dump

A suitably prepared dump of the database.

These dumps are large (~1TB, >50B positions) and might take several hours to download.

* Dumps can be obtained from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/robertnurnberg/chessdbcn).

```
hf download --repo-type dataset robertnurnberg/chessdbcn --local-dir . --cache-dir . --include "chess-20250608/**"
```

* Alternatively, and slower, at the chessdb source:

```
wget -c -r -nH --cut-dirs=2 --no-parent --reject="index.html*" -e robots=off ftp://chessdb:chessdb@ftp.chessdb.cn/pub/chessdb/chess-20250608
```

Note: to be able to handle the database the user should be able to open a
sufficiently large number of files (more than the typical default of 1024),
increase that limit e.g. `ulimit -n 102400` for each shell manually or adjust
the defaults (e.g. `/etc/security/limits.conf`, `/etc/systemd/system.conf`, and/or `/etc/systemd/user.conf`).

### Compiled rocksdb fork

On Ubuntu, install the needed prerequisites:

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-fiber-dev libtbb-dev autoconf cmake build-essential curl git
```

Clone noobpwnftw's terakdb repo and build it

```
git clone https://github.com/noobpwnftw/terarkdb.git
cd terarkdb
./build.sh
```

After building, ensure this repo's Makefile variables `TERARKDBROOT` and `CHESSDB_PATH` point to `/the/full/path/of/terarkdb/`
and the path of the DB dump, respectively.
